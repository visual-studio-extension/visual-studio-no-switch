## VisualStudio.NoSwitch

Thai keyboard layout is crazy when working with VsVim,
This extension allow me to produce thai characters without switch layout.

## How

- Type start token `~`
- Type thai character without switch layout, extension transform character into thai.
- Type ending token `~` to stop transform, extension remove all `~` and display only thai characters.

> `~d`    => `~ก`
> `~กb`   => `~กิ`
> `~กิo`   => `~กิน`
> `~กิน~`  => `กิน`
